                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academy+Plus project had a huge impact on my learning behaviour. You had to do a lot of research on your own to learn how to make assignments that had to be delivered each day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere here was really pleasant and the big advantage was that you were in the same room with 30-40 more coders from which you could ask for help anytime.</p>

                    <p> Here at Academy+PLUS I had the chance<br> to develop my coding skills under a very<br> strict environment, being able to pass<br> through the admission period (the "pool")<br> and to continue working on my skills. I<br> also had the opportunity to work with<br> various people on different projects in<br> C/C++</p>

                    <p>July 2016</p>
                    <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interact is Rotary Internationalâ€™s service club for young<br> people ages 12 to 18. Interact clubs are sponsored by<br> individual Rotary clubs, which provide support and<br> guidance, but they are self-governing and self-supporting.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, Interact clubs complete at least two <br>community service projects, one of which furthers<br> international understanding and goodwill. Through these <br>efforts, Interactors develop a network of friendships with<br> local and overseas clubs and learn the importance of:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Developing leadership skills and personal integrity<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Demonstrating helpfulness and respect for others<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Understanding the value of individual responsibilit</em></p>
                    <h4>My role</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I started volunteering at Interact in 2014 because of my<br> desire to help the community in which I live and try to<br> make a change in the world. Through Interact I developed<br> many of my abilities(social skills, oratorical skills, leadership,<br> human resources etc.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned the difference between a leader and a boss<br> and I have learned that if you really want to<br> do something you can do it. I started as a simple member,<br> then i was chosen as Officer of Recruitment. During this<br> period as an officer, i managed to learn a lot about people's<br> behavior under stressful situations.</p>
